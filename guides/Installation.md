# Installation

> [!WARNING]
> If you're using PicoCalc, make sure to update your keyboard firmware first: https://github.com/jblanked/awesome-pico-calc/blob/master/GettingStarted.md#updating-the-stm32>

**Universal Method**
1. Download the appropriate build from the `builds` directory.
2. Press and hold the `BOOT` button on your Raspberry Pi Pico/W or Pico 2/2W.
3. While holding the `BOOT` button, connect the Pico to your computer using a USB cable (that supports data transfer) until your computer recognizes a new storage device.
4. Drag and drop the downloaded file onto the device that appears (it should be named `RPI-RP2` if using a Raspberry Pi Pico/W or `RP2350` if using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2/2W). 
5. Once the file transfer is complete, the Pico will eject itself. Disconnect the USB cable from your Pico.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are installing the MicroPython version, copy the `apps` folder from `builds/MicroPython` to the `picoware` folder on your SD card. If there is no `picoware` folder, create one.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are installing the CircuitPython version, after installing Picoware, replace the `code.py` file on your Pico with the one from `src/CircuitPython`.

**Video Game Module (Only)**
1. Install the Video Game Module Tool app on your Flipper Zero from the Apps catalog: [Video Game Module Tool](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/video_game_module_tool).
2. Download the `Picoware-VGM.uf2` from the `builds` directory.
3. Disconnect your Video Game Module from your Flipper and connect your Flipper to your computer.
4. Open qFlipper.
5. Navigate to the `SD Card/apps_data/vgm/` directory. If the folder doesn’t exist, create it. Inside that folder, create a folder named `Picoware`.
6. Drag the `Picoware-VGM.uf2` file you downloaded earlier into the `Picoware` directory.
7. Disconnect your Flipper from your computer, then turn it off.
8. Connect your Video Game Module to your Flipper, then turn your Flipper on.
9. Open the Video Game Module Tool app on your Flipper. It should be located in the `Apps -> Tools` folder from the main menu.
10. In the Video Game Module Tool app, select `Install Firmware from File`, then choose `apps_data`.
11. Scroll down and click on the `vgm` folder, then the `Picoware` folder, and finally select the `Picoware-VGM.uf2` file.
12. The app will begin flashing Picoware to your Video Game Module. Wait until the process is complete.
